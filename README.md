## Python Package Exploration Project

### Overview
This repository contains multiple Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of various Python packages for text-to-speech, online information retrieval, and speech recognition functionalities. The goal is to explore how these packages work, adjust their parameters, and combine them to create a functional system using voice commands.

### Packages Used
1) pyttsx3: Used for converting text to speech. It allows adjusting the rate, volume, and voice of the speech output.
2) pywhatkit: Used for performing various internet-related tasks, such as sending WhatsApp messages, searching on Google, and more.
3) wikipedia: Used for retrieving summaries from Wikipedia articles based on search queries.
